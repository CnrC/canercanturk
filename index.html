	<p><h3>&nbsp I'm Chewbacca, a 200-year-old Wookiee. I become Han Solo's companion
	after Han, an Imperial officer at the time, refused an order to kill him,
	for which Han was dismissed from the Imperial Navy and became a smuggler.
	To repay my debt, I protected Han for the rest of his life, 
	and served as his co-pilot on the Millennium Falcon.I'm 2.28m tall, 
	I'm covered with long hair, and I wear only a
	bandolier. My weapon of choice is the Wookiee bowcaster 
	(a crossbow-shaped directed-energy weapon).
